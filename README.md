It looks so simple app, but this application is not just simple. We change this design according to our taste.

Probably We will releasing this December 21 in the PlayStore at free.

We make this memo application at this way

First, App has three buttons at the top of app's display

Buttons are Save TXT, LOAD TXT, DELETE. It is very simple.

Second, At first we will make it very simple function because of we are not good at making android application.
